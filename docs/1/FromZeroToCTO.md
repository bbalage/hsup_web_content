# From Zero to CTO – bónusz

**Being the CTO of your startup is no easy job.**

## The beginning of a CTO

Flexibility, vision, great technical knowledge, and a way with people are the characteristics of a great CTO. Oh, and also being able to adjust the product, when it is necessary. As you’ll see in other bonus chapters, business agendas are rarely in alignment with creating a beautiful and modern platform. Most of the time, due to time constrictions from the business side, you’ll be requested to make changes, cut out entire features and reorganize back-end structures in a matter of two, short weeks. This puts incredible pressure on your and your team’s creativity and drives to build things. As a smart person told us once, creating art is a product never released. At one point, the sooner the better, you got to let go of the notion of the perfect product. It just doesn’t exist. There are, however, products that make money early on and make everyone happy because there’s money in your pockets, and products that are never released, that make your team frustrated and your management disappointed. Building a startup is full of these compromises that actually help you release a product on time from the right angle to hit the market. As a CTO your responsibility is to communicate these market needs between business and your development team. On the first day of your job, you can create a matrix where you draw money and a “no-spaghetti code”, beautifully designed UX epitome of a product running on the newest, flashiest technology ever. These two things are just like the same pole of a magnet, they just won’t fit and you’ll end up losing time, money, and your motivation.
